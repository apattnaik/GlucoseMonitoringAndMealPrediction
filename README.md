CGM prediction Project
In this project, we will develop a continuous meal detection method from glucose monitor data of a subject. You will be given CGM sensor outputs for a given person for nearly 6 months. The CGM output is every 5 mins. You will also be given ground truth for every meal instance. You will have to develop a continuous meal detection algorithm.
